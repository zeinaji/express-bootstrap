# Express Bootstrap

This project is a boilerplate for Node.js/Express applications. It also comes included with Jest, and Supertest for end-to-end testing.

## Getting started

Ensure your Visual Studio Code application is up to date, and that you have the [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) installed and enabled.

Replace `your-project-folder-name` with the folder name you wish to create for your project and run the below inside your `Projects` folder.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MCRcodes/express-bootstrap.git your-project-folder-name
cd your-project-folder-name
npm install
npm start
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000/] in your browser and you should see `Hello world!`. You can dive in and start coding your own routes in `src/app.js`.

## Running tests

You can run tests with the `npm test` command.
